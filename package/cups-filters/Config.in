	  This project provides backends, filters, and other software that was
	  once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer maintained
	  by Apple Inc. In addition it contains additional filters and software
	  developed independently of Apple, especially filters for the PDF-
	  centric printing workflow introduced by OpenPrinting and a daemon
	  to browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote CUPS printers to make these
	  printers available locally and to provide backward compatibility to
	  the old CUPS broadcasting and browsing of CUPS 1.5.x and older.
	  From CUPS 1.6.0 on, this package is required for using printer drivers
	  with CUPS under Linux. With CUPS 1.5.x and earlier this package can be
	  used optionally to switch over to PDF-based printing.
